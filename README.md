# Hello! üëã
I'm Muhammed, an undergraduate Electrical and Computer Engineering student at [Tanta University](https://tanta.edu.eg/). I'm fascinated by human intelligence, consciousness, evolution, life, and all that complicated awesome stuff we take for granted. So, Machine learning, Deep Learning, and specifically Deep Reinforcement learning were the areas I found most intersting,, I love it and it influenced my philosophy and my whole view of life.

I have some experience working on secure machine learning as a cryptography team member of OpenMined, it's also something I love doing, protecting privacy, it makes me feel like a superhero. I love whatever influences people's lives and makes the world a better place, that my value function I work to maximize. 

## Projects

I work mainly on [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft), Specficlly on Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) cryptographic protocols:

 - **Falcon**: it's is ‚Äì an end-to-end 3-party protocol for fast and secure computation of deep learning algorithms on large networks, it is the current state of art, I lead the implementation of that protocol to provide an easy to understand and use interface that look almost identical to PyTorch interface, we don't have a tutorial yet as it's work-in-progress, but that should be available soon, join OpenMined slack to keep up to date.
 - **SecureNN**: it's the previuos state-of-art before faclon, it serves the same perpous, and it's already done and it has tutorials in PySyft repo, I implementd the maxpool and avgpool alogrithms of that protocol, you can run them in this [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19YLIWdf_HwX0c7lqD7uZuW-FtR00moyH)
 - **Basedataset**: it's the dataset class of PySyft, my first contribution to pysyft was to redesign this class to enable sending it in only one communication round, I also added a number of features to make it searchable and gettable, see this [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1axlCZTVpW-ierD-_JEa6piNddoAfW8MH) for a tutorial  
 
 ## Writings
 
I don't see a point of making my own blog, I'm not that influential, so I use medium:
 - [Debug your life like a DRL agent](https://medium.com/@abogaziah/debug-your-life-like-a-drl-agent-cf34b0a6d6d)   (I'm so proud of this one ‚ù§)
 -  [The essence of modular arithmetic](https://medium.com/@abogaziah/the-essence-of-modular-arithmetic-d43418789f51?source=your_stories_page---------------------------)
 - [Assemble your Zero cost, Zero programming, no time, reservation&check-in system](https://medium.com/@abogaziah/assemble-your-zero-cost-zero-programming-no-time-reservation-check-in-system-93a4124374f2?source=your_stories_page---------------------------)
